## FFT
This project includes a research paper and poster which was accepted to the SC19 Conference. It discusses a research project 
in which we accelerated a 3D Fast Fourier Transform with half-precision floating point hardware on a GPU. It was written by 
Yanming Kang and myself during a research for undergraduates (REU) program at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville (UTK), 
collaborating with Dr. Eduardo D'Azevedo of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Dr. Kwai Wong of UTK, and Dr. Stanimire Tomov of UTK. The project can also be found [here](https://www.jics.utk.edu/recsem-reu/recsem19/projects).
